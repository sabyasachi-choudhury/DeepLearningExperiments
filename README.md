This project is one of two repos containing random exploration and experimentation I'd done with deep learning libraries like Tensorflow as a 10th grader.

If you're reading this, I'll be honest with you - I did not know or understand what I was doing, just that it occasionally led to some very cool programs. However, 
this was a very useful and enlightening experience as it showed me that I still had a lot to learn, while also making me curious and interested about things
I'd get to properly understand and use when I grew older.

Also the experience helped me win a bunch of contests, which was very nice.
